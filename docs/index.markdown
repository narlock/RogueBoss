title: "Rogue Boss"
---
Rogue Boss is an application that implements mini "boss battles" for users to interact with a front end. A boss is chosen randomly from a list, given a type (see types). Users can attack the boss via an open-front end implementation provided by developers that utilize Rogue Boss. Rogue Boss acts as a back end application that can receive RESTful API requests to attack the boss while also storing boss data locally using a JSON format. Rogue Boss also implements a simple GUI that contains a simple animation and health bar indicating the current status of each events that are send via the API.
